# Robot Maze
- Watch this robot as it finds its way through the maze, all the way to the star.

# How To Run
- You need Xcode installed on your Computer (Xcode is available as a free download for Mac only).
- Open `Maze.xcodeproj` in Xcode (from part 1 through part 3), click on the "play" button.
- Enjoy watching the robot as it figures its way around the maze.
- Part 1 is the dumbest robot, and might not even reach the star (or it might take a while - 3 minutes).
- Part 2 already has some brains (1-2 minutes).
- Part 3 usually takes very little to get to the star (30 seconds).
